  Hello, my name is Chris Diana!
  I am a developer &amp; designer with a passion for innovative technology currently based in Boulder, CO.
</div>

By day, I lead the innovation software development team at PenLink
where we quickly prototype, develop and validate scalable, machine learning applications.
In my freetime, I enjoy experimenting with the latest web technologies and sharing what I learn.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to work with some really great people and companies on some
really cool projects. Here are a few of the great companies I've worked with.

Because of the nature of business that many of clients I've worked with are in, I am not able to display some my work on this site.
If you would like to see some examples, please [reach out]() and I'll forward over a few!
Otherwise, feel free to view some of my work [here]().
